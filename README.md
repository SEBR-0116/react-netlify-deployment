# React Netlify deployment

## Getting Started 

Before we begin, lets go into our app's main folder and touch a file called `_redirects`, which will be a sibling to your package.json and index.html files, and your public and src folders. Like our .env and .gitignore it doesn't get a standard name, it simply is called "_redirects". Don't forget the underscore!

In your _redirects file, which is a sibling to your index.html file, add in this line of code:
```
/* /index.html 200
```

This will set a redirect to your index.html file and allow your routes to load correctly if you send over anything besides the landing page.

Once we have this set, lets get started. Run "npm run build" in your root directory to create a new folder called "dist", which will give us all of the tools necessary to deploy the page.

Once our files are complete and pushed to git, create your own Netlify account. Signing up with Github is recommended for easy deployment, and is the method this guide is following.

After creating an account, there will be a few user questions. Follow through the prompts until you get to this page:

Select import from an existing project

Your screen will look like the image below.

Now we want to connect to the Git provider, select Github

The following page will allow you to select any repos in your Github account. Search and select the repo you wish to deploy.

Note: While you *can* deploy from any branch, Netlify is much happier working with your Main branch, so make sure that is up to date with all of your most recent code and changes!

Now we want to give Netlify a few instructions when deploying your site. In the base directory section add the name of your react app, NOT your root directory/GitHub repo name. In the build command section include 'npm run build', and for your publish directory 'build'.  

Note - if you are using an app created on Vite, change "build" to "dist"

Now you can select deploy site. This will bring you to the following page:

In "Build and Deploy", change your "Build" command to be "CI= npm run build"

Then change your Environment Values to have a Key of "CI" and a value of "False"

It may take a few minutes to a few hours for your react site to fully deploy, so be patient. Once your site is deployed you can edit the domain name and send the URL to friends and family!
